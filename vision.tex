\section{Computer Vision}
\label{sec:vision}
Various vision algorithms are needed for more careful perception and analysis of Pepper's environment pn object and huamn level. 
To start interaction, our Pepper can detect and recognize different people, remember their names and some other features, and track them using its camera data. \
Then, more interested skills will be shown to carry more complex tasks. 
For example, some tasks require human posture recognition so an alogorithm based on ?? is developed. 
It can recognize human skeleton so that we can judge whether a person is standing, sitting or pointing somewhere. 
For object-level environment reasoning, a detection and recognition framework based on YOLO can quickly detect a predefined object and print its predefined name in the figure.
