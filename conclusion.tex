\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we describe TJArk@Home's work towards RoboCup@Home competition and outline functions we have implemented on Pepper.
After continuous improvement, our software has become a complete system, with many integrated applications.
Besides software development, several researches are also embeded in our preparation for the competition, including computer vision, VSLAM, HRI.

Future works are wide-ranging.
First, the software framework should be simplified and documented in order to increase re-usability and open source.
Then, many application can't reach the real-time need for domestic tasks. So we will try to improve the efficiency and speed up program execution.
A very tough obstacle on Pepper is that its fingers, with only one degree of freedom, are not flexible to finish accurate grabbing tasks.
We are considering alternative solutions such as using two hands for grasping.
Although a framework is developed, there are many specific tasks requiring highly integration of basic functions.
So there is a long way for us to make Pepper perform better in an actual task.
